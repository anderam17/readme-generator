## Description
This project uses the terminal to produce a comprehensive read-me file. The user is prompted with questions to populate the project title, description, installation and usage instructions, requirements for contributions, test instructions, licenses, and contact information. 

After the prompts are completed, a readMe file is generated with the name of the project as it's filename and title. The answers given by the user are used to make their respective sections on the readMe as well as creating a clickable table of contents that takes you to different sections of the page. 

## Installation Instructions
    npm i
